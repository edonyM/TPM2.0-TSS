# Overview
This repository hosts source code implementing the Trusted Computing Group's (TCG) TPM2 Software Stack (TSS).
This stack consists of the following layers from top to bottom:

* System API (SAPI) as described in the  [system level API and TPM command transmission interface specification](http://www.trustedcomputinggroup.org/resources/tss_system_level_api_and_tpm_command_transmission_interface_specification).
This API is a 1-to-1 mapping of the TPM2 commands documented in Part 3 of the TPM2 specification.
Additionally there are asynchronous versions of each command.
These asynchronous variants may be useful for integration into event-driven programming environments.
Both the synchronous and asynchronous API are exposed through a single library: libsapi.
* TPM Command Transmission Interface (TCTI) that is described in the same specification.
This API provides a standard interface to transmit / receive TPM command / response buffers.
It is expected that any number of libraries implementing the TCTI API will be implemented as a way to abstract various platform specific IPC mechanisms.
Currently this repository provides two TCTI implementations: libtcti-device and libtcti-socket.
The prior should be used for direct access to the TPM through the Linux kernel driver.
The later implements the protocol exposed by the Microsoft software TPM2 simulator.

# Build and Installation Instructions:
Instructions to build and install tpm2-tss are available in the [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) file.

# Getting in Touch:
If you're looking to discuss the source code in this project or get some questions answered you should join the 01org TPM2 mailing list: https://lists.01.org/mailman/listinfo/tpm2.
We've also got an IRC channel set up on [FreeNode](https://freenode.net/) called #tpm2.0-tss.

# Test Suite
This repository contains a test suite intended to exercise the TCTI and SAPI code.
This test suite is *not* intended to test a TPM implementation and so this test suite should only be run against a TPM simulator.
If this test suite is executed against a TPM other than the software simulator it may cause damage to the TPM (NV storage wear out etc).
You have been warned.

## Simulator
The TPM library specification contains reference code sufficient to construct a software TPM 2.0 simulator.
This code was provided by Microsoft and they provide a binary download for Windows [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=52507).
IBM has repackaged this code with a few Makefiles so that the Microsoft code can be built and run on Linux systems.
The Linux version of the Microsoft TPM 2.0 simulator can be obtained [here](https://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/ibmswtpm2/ibmtpm532.tar).
Once you've downloaded and successfully built and execute the simulator it will, by default, be accepting connections on the localhost, port 2321.

Issues building or running the simulator should be reported to the IBM software TPM2 project.

NOTE: The Intel TCG TSS is currently tested against the 532 version of the simulator.
Compatibility with later versions has not yet been tested.

## Test Suite
The test suite is implemented in the tpmclient program.
This is a monolithic C program that exercises various TCTI and SAPI API calls.
Once the test environment is set up (simulator is built and running), the tpmclient program can be executed:

```
$ test/tpmclient/tpmclient
```

The `tpmclient` program will run either until completion, or until an error occurs.
Please report failures in a Github 'issue' with a full log of the test run.
This must include output from the `tpmclient` program.
This output must include full debug messages which requires that the libraries and binaries be built with debug flags enabled.
See [INSTALL](INSTALL) for instructions to build with debug flags enabled.

## Test Suite Decomposition
We are currently working to decompose the existing monolithic `tpmclient` program into individual test programs that can be integrated into an automated test harness.
This approach has a number of advantages including the ability to run individual tests in isolation as well as reduced overhead, maintenance and automation.
